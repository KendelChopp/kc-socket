# Kendel Circle Backend Server
## Disclaimer
This code is no bueno. I made this in a day. I am not proud of this, but it works for what I needed it to work for. Check out [the YouTube video about the creation of this here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiXy9zEm8FA).

## Overview
This is the backend server for the web app. It uses a database singleton (read: not an actual database), Socket.io to send and receive messages, and express for html routing.

## How to run
You need Node/npm to use this.

Run `node index.js` to start the backend server.
